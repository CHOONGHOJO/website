    The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, 
    is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators 
    (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, 
    and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] 
    The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), 
    may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, 
    and are published by a software application called a web server. 
    The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, 
    which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
